# Project Components ............................
### Chemometrics ,
is the chemical discipline where we use NIR spectroscopy (in simple terms deviation of light) & statistics to 
perform modelling tasks & to find out chemical properties of a substance.

### PLSR Regression  ,
we use PLSR regression known as partial least square regression to model against the NIR(Near Infrared Spectroscopy) data.
PLSR is from regression family , there are few differences between plsr & PCA(Principal Component analysis, use the blogs pdf attached to know more.

## GUI Files,
There is a pyqt5 gui attached with the files where you can run the gui, the model is deployed with the gui , which will return the prediction results.

### Dataset,
here I have used BRIX dataset , given by @nirpyresearch

# Database,
here i have used MySQL database to store essential data information about the customer , feel free to replace it.
